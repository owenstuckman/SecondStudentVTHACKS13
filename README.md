Inspiration
One of the biggest inconveniences we all have as students is having to use and interact with tons of different tools and software. From this inconvenience, a dream was born, to try and unite all the common day to day pieces a student interacts with into one holistic software. One of our big focuses was how much we disliked canvas, and wanted something more flexible and that we ourselves could work with.

What it does
Second student is a text editor and platform for creating and finding the best way to manage your notes and in general your education. It provides additional tools like a calendar, notes, and numerous plugins into commonly used tools in higher education.

How we built it
We built it with flutter (dart) since multiplatform was extremely important. Due to the time pinch, we decided to work with Supabase out of convenience, rather than developing our own custom solution. Additionally used the Gemini API for many of our AI needs, and worked with many libraries off of pub.dev.

Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we ran into was the initial library we started off of was not lightweight enough, and converted all of the notes into dart, with extremely limited formatting for exporting it out. We had to trash the majority of our progress after about 12 hours in, and start from near square one.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
The product is extremely functional, and everything operates as expected. We hit our target for functionality, and we are really excited we hit such a high bar.

What we learned
We learned a lot about multiplatform distribution and how to debug across multiple environments.

What's next for Second Student
There were tons of plugins we did not get to create that we would like to make now, including interactions with microsoft products and similar programs. Additionally, we would like to roll out even more impressive AI assistant features and roll out a freemium business model.
