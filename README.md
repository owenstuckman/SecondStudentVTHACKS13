# Inspiration
One of the biggest inconveniences we all have as students is having to use and interact with tons of different tools and software. From this inconvenience, a dream was born—to try and unite all the common day-to-day pieces a student interacts with into one holistic software. One of our big focuses was how much we disliked Canvas, and wanted something more flexible and that we ourselves could work with.

# What It Does
**Second Student** is a text editor and platform for creating and finding the best way to manage your notes and, in general, your education. It provides additional tools like a calendar, notes, and numerous plugins into commonly used tools in higher education.

# How We Built It
We built it with **Flutter (Dart)** since multiplatform support was extremely important. Due to the time pinch, we decided to work with **Supabase** out of convenience, rather than developing our own custom solution. We also used the **Gemini API** for many of our AI needs and worked with many libraries from **pub.dev**.

# Challenges We Ran Into
One of the biggest challenges we ran into was that the initial library we started with was not lightweight enough and converted all of the notes into Dart, with extremely limited formatting for exporting. We had to scrap the majority of our progress after about 12 hours and start from near square one.

# Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
The product is extremely functional, and everything operates as expected. We hit our target for functionality, and we’re really excited we reached such a high bar.

# What We Learned
We learned a lot about multiplatform distribution and how to debug across multiple environments.

# What's Next for Second Student
There were tons of plugins we didn’t get to create that we’d like to make now, including interactions with Microsoft products and similar programs. Additionally, we’d like to roll out even more impressive AI assistant features and introduce a freemium business model.
